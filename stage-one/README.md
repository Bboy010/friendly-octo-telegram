# Team Instructions:

## As usual, you can decide to use Python or R, even within a team, but:
You have to provide all 4 functions for each language when submitting
---
# Tasks : Functions Galore!
1. Write a function for translating DNA to protein
2. Write a function that simulates and generates a logistic population growth curve. 
* Your function should include 2 extra parameters that randomize the length of the lag phase and the exponential phase [See population curve here]. 
* Most living populations follow a logistic population growth.
* Therefore, your growth curve can be: 
    * Population Size vs Time, 
    * Cell density vs Time, 
    * OD vs Time, 
    * CFU vs Time, etc
3. Using your function, generate a dataframe with 100 different growth curves
4. Write a function for determining the time to reach 80% of the maximum growth; usually the carrying capacity
5. Finally, write a function for calculating the hamming distance between your Slack username and twitter/X handle (synthesize if you donâ€™t have one). Feel free to pad it with extra words if they are not of the same length.
